Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer. In this article Setting up Git Next steps: Authenticating with GitHub from Git Celebrate To use Git on the command line, you'll need to download, install, and configure Git on your computer. You can also install GitHub CLI to use GitHub from the command line. For more information on GitHub CLI, see the GitHub CLI documentation. If you want to work with Git locally, but don't want to use the command line, you can instead download and install the GitHub Desktop client. For more information, see "Installing and configuring GitHub Desktop." If you don't need to work with files locally, GitHub lets you complete many Git-related actions directly in the browser, including: Creating a repository Forking a repository Managing files Being social Setting up Git Download and install the latest version of Git. Set your username in Git. Set your commit email address in Git. Next steps: Authenticating with GitHub from Git When you connect to a GitHub repository from Git, you'll need to authenticate with GitHub using either HTTPS or SSH. Connecting over HTTPS (recommended) If you clone with HTTPS, you can cache your GitHub credentials in Git using a credential helper. Connecting over SSH If you clone with SSH, you must generate SSH keys on each computer you use to push or pull from GitHub. Celebrate Congratulations, you now have Git and GitHub all set up!

In this article Commit your first change Celebrate You can store a variety of projects in GitHub repositories, including open source projects. With open source projects, you can share code to make better, more reliable software. Note: You can create public repositories for an open source project. When creating your public repository, make sure to include a license file that determines how you want your project to be shared with others. For more information on open source, specifically how to create and grow an open source project, we've created Open Source Guides that will help you foster a healthy open source community by recommending best practices for creating and maintaining repositories for your open source project. You can also take a free GitHub Learning Lab course on maintaining open source communities. In the upper-right corner of any page, use the drop-down menu, and select New repository. Type a short, memorable name for your repository. For example, "hello-world". Optionally, add a description of your repository. For example, "My first repository on GitHub." Choose a repository visibility. For more information, see "About repository visibility." Select Initialize this repository with a README. Click Create repository. Congratulations! You've successfully created your first repository, and initialized it with a README file. Tip: You can also create repositories using the GitHub CLI. For more information, see "gh repo create" in the GitHub CLI documentation. Commit your first change A commit is like a snapshot of all the files in your project at a particular point in time. When you created your new repository, you initialized it with a README file. README files are a great place to describe your project in more detail, or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. The contents of your README file are automatically shown on the front page of your repository. Let's commit a change to the README file. In your repository's list of files, click README.md. Above the file's content, click . On the Edit file tab, type some information about yourself. Above the new content, click Preview changes. Review the changes you made to the file. You'll see the new content in green. At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message. For more information, see "Creating a commit with multiple co-authors." Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request. For more information, see "Creating a new pull request."

Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. In this article Fork an example repository Keep your fork synced Find another repository to fork Celebrate Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. Propose changes to someone else's project For example, you can use forks to propose changes related to fixing a bug. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can: Fork the repository. Make the fix. Submit a pull request to the project owner. Use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. Open source software is based on the idea that by sharing code, we can make better, more reliable software. For more information, see the "About the Open Source Initiative" on the Open Source Initiative. For more information about applying open source principles to your organization's development work on GitHub, see GitHub's white paper "An introduction to innersource." When creating your public repository from a fork of someone's project, make sure to include a license file that determines how you want your project to be shared with others. For more information, see "Choose an open source license" at choosealicense.com. For more information on open source, specifically how to create and grow an open source project, we've created Open Source Guides that will help you foster a healthy open source community by recommending best practices for creating and maintaining repositories for your open source project. You can also take a free GitHub Learning Lab course on maintaining open source communities. Note: You can use GitHub Desktop to fork a repository. For more information, see "Cloning and forking repositories from GitHub Desktop." Tip: You can also fork a repository using the GitHub CLI. For more information, see "gh repo fork" in the GitHub CLI documentation. Fork an example repository Forking a repository is a simple two-step process. We've created a repository for you to practice with. On GitHub, navigate to the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork. Keep your fork synced You might fork a project to propose changes to the upstream, or original, repository. In this case, it's good practice to regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository. To do this, you'll need to use Git on the command line. You can practice setting the upstream repository using the same octocat/Spoon-Knife repository you just forked. Step 1: Set up Git If you haven't yet, you should first set up Git. Don't forget to set up authentication to GitHub from Git as well. Step 2: Create a local clone of your fork Right now, you have a fork of the Spoon-Knife repository, but you don't have the files in that repository on your computer. Let's create a clone of your fork locally on your computer. On GitHub, navigate to your fork of the Spoon-Knife repository. Above the list of files, click Code. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", click . To clone the repository using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click Use SSH, then click . To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click Use GitHub CLI, then click . Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of YOUR-USERNAME: $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Spoon-Knife Press Enter. Your local clone will be created. $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Spoon-Knife
> Cloning into `Spoon-Knife`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done. Now, you have a local copy of your fork of the Spoon-Knife repository. Step 3: Configure Git to sync your fork with the original Spoon-Knife repository When you fork a project in order to propose changes to the original repository, you can configure Git to pull changes from the original, or upstream, repository into the local clone of your fork. On GitHub, navigate to the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository. Above the list of files, click Code. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", click . To clone the repository using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click Use SSH, then click . To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click Use GitHub CLI, then click . Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash. Change directories to the location of the fork you cloned in Step 2: Create a local clone of your fork. To go to your home directory, type just cd with no other text. To list the files and folders in your current directory, type ls. To go into one of your listed directories, type cd your_listed_directory. To go up one directory, type cd ... Type git remote -v and press Enter. You'll see the current configured remote repository for your fork. $ git remote -v
> origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push) Type git remote add upstream, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2 and press Enter. It will look like this: $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git To verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork, type git remote -v again. You should see the URL for your fork as origin, and the URL for the original repository as upstream. $ git remote -v
> origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
> origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)
> upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (push) Now, you can keep your fork synced with the upstream repository with a few Git commands. For more information, see "Syncing a fork." Next steps You can make any changes to a fork, including: Creating branches: Branches allow you to build new features or test out ideas without putting your main project at risk. Opening pull requests: If you are hoping to contribute back to the original repository, you can send a request to the original author to pull your fork into their repository by submitting a pull request. Find another repository to fork Fork a repository to start contributing to a project. You can fork a repository to your user account or any organization where you have repository creation permissions. For more information, see "Permission levels for an organization." If you have access to a private repository and the owner permits forking, you can fork the repository to your user account or any organization on GitHub Team where you have repository creation permissions. You cannot fork a private repository to an organization using GitHub Free. For more information, see "GitHub's products." You can browse Explore to find projects and start contributing to open source repositories. For more information, see "Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub."

These features are also enabled for public repositories on GitHub.com. In this article About GitHub Advanced Security About Advanced Security features About Advanced Security licensing Enabling Advanced Security features on GitHub.com About GitHub Advanced Security GitHub has many features that help you improve and maintain the quality of your code. Some of these are included in all plans, for example: dependency graph and Dependabot alerts. Other security features require a license for GitHub Advanced Security to run on repositories apart from public repositories on GitHub.com. (That is, private and internal repositories on GitHub.com, and all repositories on GitHub Enterprise Server.) For an overview of all security features, see "About securing your repository." For information about permission requirements for actions related to security features, see "Repository permission levels for an organization." About Advanced Security features A GitHub Advanced Security license provides the following additional features: Code scanning - Search for potential security vulnerabilities and coding errors in your code. For more information, see "About code scanning." Secret scanning - Detect secrets, for example keys and tokens, that have been checked into the repository. For more information, see "About secret scanning." Dependency review - Show the full impact of changes to dependencies and see details of any vulnerable versions before you merge a pull request. For more information, see "Reviewing dependency changes in a pull request." For information about Advanced Security features that are in development, see "GitHub public roadmap." About Advanced Security licensing Each license for GitHub Advanced Security specifies a maximum number of committers whose work can use these features. A committer is someone who authored at least one commit that was pushed to the repository in the last 90 days. Each committer is counted once, no matter how many repositories they contribute to. When you enable GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub shows how many extra committers this will add and prompts for confirmation. If you disable access to GitHub Advanced Security, you can see how many seats this will free before you confirm the change. This makes it easy to see the impact of your changes on the use of your license. Enabling Advanced Security features on GitHub.com For public repositories on GitHub.com, these features are permanently on and are only disabled if you change the visibility of the project so that the code is no longer public. For other repositories, once you have a license for your organization or enterprise, you can enable and disable these features at the organization or repository level. For more information, see "Managing security and analysis settings for your organization" and "Managing security and analysis settings for your repository." If you have an enterprise account, license use for the enterprise is shown on your billing page. For more information, see "Managing use of Advanced Security for organizations in your enterprise account." For information about purchasing a license for GitHub Advanced Security, contact GitHub's Sales team. Did this doc help you? Privacy policy Want to learn about new docs features and updates?

In this article What plans and pricing changes did GitHub announce on April 14? How can I upgrade my plan? How can I downgrade my plan? If I downgrade from GitHub Team or a Legacy plan to GitHub Free, what features will I lose? How can I create a GitHub Free or GitHub Team organization? How can I compare which features are in each plan? How long will GitHub Free allow unlimited collaborators? I already paid for the yearly Pro or Team plan, do I get a refund for the price difference? What is the difference between GitHub Free for individual developers and GitHub Free for organizations? How can I get more Actions minutes if I need more than allocated in the GitHub Team plan? How do the seat limit changes affect me? Is anything changing for teams on the GitHub Team for Open Source plan? What is GitHub Community Support? How does this change affect education benefits? How does this affect me if I currently pay by invoice? How will this impact users and organizations in regions where U.S. government sanctions are applied? What plans and pricing changes did GitHub announce on April 14? GitHub announced the following plans and pricing changes: GitHub Free for organizations is immediately available and includes private repositories for unlimited users All organizations previously using Team for Open Source now have GitHub Free GitHub Free for individual developers now includes unlimited collaborators Organizations and individuals using GitHub Free will receive GitHub Community Support GitHub Pro will now include 2GB of Packages storage and 10GB of data transfer GitHub Pro now has a reduced monthly price of $4 GitHub Team now has a reduced monthly price of $4 per user GitHub Team no longer has a required five-seat minimum GitHub Team includes 3,000 Actions minutes per month for private repositories How can I upgrade my plan? To upgrade your user account's plan, see "Upgrading your personal account's subscription." To upgrade your organization's plan, see "Upgrading your organization's subscription." How can I downgrade my plan? To downgrade your user account's plan, see "Downgrading your user account's subscription." To downgrade your organization's plan, see "Downgrading your organization's subscription." If I downgrade from GitHub Team or a Legacy plan to GitHub Free, what features will I lose? Required reviewers in private repositories Protected branches in private repositories Code owners in private repositories GitHub Pages in private repositories Wikis in private repositories Multiple assignees for issues and pull requests in private repositories Multiple pull request reviewers in private repositories Draft pull requests in private repositories Autolinked references in private repositories Standard support How can I create a GitHub Free or GitHub Team organization? If you have a GitHub account, create a new organization on our team plan page. If you don’t have a GitHub account, you can create one on our homepage and you’ll be prompted to create an organization during the sign-up process. How can I compare which features are in each plan? You can see pricing and a full list of features for each product at https://github.com/pricing. How long will GitHub Free allow unlimited collaborators? Forever! This change is permanent. I already paid for the yearly Pro or Team plan, do I get a refund for the price difference? Customers who are currently paying annually for Pro and Team plans and signed up before April 14 will receive a refund for a prorated amount through the end of their annual billing term. For example, if you are two months into your subscription that is billed annually, you will receive a refund for the price difference for the remaining ten months. These refunds will be processed in approximately 30 days. Once your refund is processed, a notification will be sent to the billing email. What is the difference between GitHub Free for individual developers and GitHub Free for organizations? For details on the differences for each GitHub Free product, see "GitHub's products." How can I get more Actions minutes if I need more than allocated in the GitHub Team plan? Most small teams use fewer than 3,000 Actions minutes/month, but some teams might use more. If your team needs additional minutes for private repositories, you can increase your spending limit for GitHub Actions. Actions minutes and Packages storage are still free for your public repositories. For more information, see "Managing your spending limit for GitHub Actions." How do the seat limit changes affect me? Now that GitHub Team has no minimum seat requirement, if you are using fewer than five seats in your organization, you can remove paid seats to reduce your bill. For more information, see "Downgrading your GitHub subscription." Is anything changing for teams on the GitHub Team for Open Source plan? If your organization account currently uses the GitHub Team for Open Source plan, you’ve been automatically moved to GitHub Free, which includes private repositories with unlimited collaborators, 2,000 Actions minutes for private repositories, and GitHub Community Support. Actions minutes and Packages storage are still free for your public repositories. What is GitHub Community Support? GitHub Community Support includes support through our Community Forum, where you can browse solutions from the GitHub community, ask new questions, and share ideas. GitHub Community Support is staffed by Support Engineers on the GitHub Team, who moderate the Community Forum along with our most active community members. If you need to report spam, report abuse, or have issues with account access, you can send a message to our Support Team on https://support.github.com/. How does this change affect education benefits? Students and teachers will continue to receive all of the benefits they get today. GitHub will continue to offer GitHub Pro as part of its Student Developer Pack benefits to all students. Additionally, teachers will continue to have access to GitHub Team as part of the Teacher Toolbox. How does this affect me if I currently pay by invoice? If you’re currently an invoice customer, email your sales representative for additional details. If you’re not sure who your sales representative is, contact your billing manager or account owner. How will this impact users and organizations in regions where U.S. government sanctions are applied? Due to U.S. trade controls law restrictions, GitHub is unable to provide private repository services and paid services to accounts in U.S. sanctioned regions. GitHub has preserved, however, access to free public repository services. Please read about GitHub and Trade Controls for more information. GitHub will continue advocating with U.S. regulators for the greatest possible access to free code collaboration services to developers in sanctioned regions, including free private repositories. We believe that offering those free services supports U.S. foreign policy of encouraging the free flow of information and free speech in those regions. Did this doc help you?

In this article Personal user accounts Organization accounts Enterprise accounts Further reading Personal user accounts A repository owned by a user account has two permission levels: the repository owner and collaborators. For more information, see "Permission levels for a user account repository." Organization accounts Organization members can have owner, billing manager, or member roles. Owners have complete administrative access to your organization, while billing managers can manage billing settings. Member is the default role for everyone else. You can manage access permissions for multiple members at a time with teams. For more information, see: "Permission levels for an organization" "Project board permissions for an organization" "Repository permission levels for an organization" "About teams" Enterprise accounts Enterprise owners have ultimate power over the enterprise account and can take every action in the enterprise account. Billing managers can manage your enterprise account's billing settings. Members and outside collaborators of organizations owned by your enterprise account are automatically members of the enterprise account, although they have no access to the enterprise account itself or its settings. For more information, see "Roles in an enterprise." Enterprise accounts are available with GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "About enterprise accounts."

Also called a personal access token. account recovery token The authentication credential stored as part of an account recovery setup called Recover Accounts Elsewhere that allows you to store this backup credential. API preview A way to try out new APIs and changes to existing API methods before they become part of the official GitHub API. appliance A software application combined with just enough operating system (JeOS) to run optimally on industry-standard hardware (typically a server) or in a virtual machine. assignee The user that is assigned to an issue. authentication code A code you'll supply, in addition to your GitHub password, when signing in with 2FA via the browser. This code is either generated by an application or delivered to your phone via text message. Also called a "2FA authentication code." base branch The branch into which changes are combined when you merge a pull request. When you create a pull request, you can change the base branch from the repository's default branch to another branch if required. basic authentication A method of authentication where the credentials are sent as unencrypted text. bio The user-generated description found on a profile: Adding a bio to your profile billing cycle The interval of time for your specific billing plan. billing email The organization email address where GitHub sends receipts, credit card or PayPal charges, and other billing-related communication. billing manager The organization member that manages billing settings for an organization. billing plan Payment plans for users and organizations that include set features for each type of plan. blame The "blame" feature in Git describes the last modification to each line of a file, which generally displays the revision, author and time. This is helpful, for example, in tracking down when a feature was added, or which commit led to a particular bug. block To remove a user's ability to collaborate on an organization's repositories. branch A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes. branch restriction A restriction that repository admins can enable so that only certain users or teams can push or make certain changes to the branch. Business plan An organization billing plan where you can collaborate on unlimited public and private repositories, allow or require organization members to authenticate to GitHub using SAML SSO, and provision and deprovision access with SAML or SCIM. CA certificate A digital certificate issued by Certificate Authority (CA) that ensures there are valid connections between two machines, such as a user's computer and GitHub.com and verifies the ownership of a site. card A movable square within a project board associated with an issue or pull request. Check A check is a type of status check on GitHub. See "Status checks." checkout You can use git checkout on the command line to create a new branch, change your current working branch to a different branch, or even to switch to a different version of a file from a different branch with git checkout [branchname] [path to file]. The "checkout" action updates all or part of the working tree with a tree object or blob from the object database, and updates the index and HEAD if the whole working tree is pointing to a new branch. cherry-picking To choose a subset of changes from a series of changes (typically commits) and record them as a new series of changes on top of a different codebase. In Git, this is performed by the git cherry-pick command to extract the change introduced by an existing commit on another branch and to record it based on the tip of the current branch as a new commit. child team Within nested teams, the subteam that inherits the parent team's access permissions and @mentions. clean A working tree is clean if it corresponds to the revision referenced by the current HEAD. Also see "dirty". clone A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. The repository you cloned is still connected to the remote version so that you can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online. clustering The ability to run GitHub Enterprise services across multiple nodes and load balance requests between them. Code frequency graph A repository graph that shows the content additions and deletions for each week in a repository's history. code of conduct A document that defines standards for how to engage in a community. code owner A person who is designated as an owner of a portion of a repository's code. The code owner is automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request (not in draft mode) that makes changes to code the code owner owns. collaborator A collaborator is a person with read and write access to a repository who has been invited to contribute by the repository owner. commit A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made. commit author The user who makes the commit. Commit graph A repository graph that shows all the commits made to a repository in the past year. commit ID Also known as SHA. A 40-character checksum hash that identifies the commit. commit message Short, descriptive text that accompanies a commit and communicates the change the commit is introducing. compare branch The branch you use to create a pull request. This branch is compared to the base branch you choose for the pull request, and the changes are identified. When the pull request is merged, the base branch is updated with the changes from the compare branch. Also known as the "head branch" of the pull request. continuous integration Also known as CI. A process that runs automated builds and tests once a person commits a change to a configured repository on GitHub. CI is a common best practice in software development that helps detect errors. contribution graph The part of a user's profile that shows their contributions over a period of up to one year, day by day. contribution guidelines A document explaining how people should contribute to your project. contributions Specific activities on GitHub that will: - Add a square to a user's contribution graph: "What counts as a contribution" - Add activities to a user's timeline on their profile: "Contribution activity" contributor A contributor is someone who does not have collaborator access to a repository but has contributed to a project and had a pull request they opened merged into the repository. Contributors graph A repository graph that displays the top 100 contributors to a repository. coupon A GitHub-provided code that users or organizations can use to pay for all or part of their subscription. cron A time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems. cURL Used in command lines or scripts to transfer data. Dashboard Your personal dashboard is the main hub of your activity on GitHub. From your personal dashboard, you can keep track of issues and pull requests you're following or working on, navigate to your top repositories and team pages, and learn about recent activity in repositories you're watching or participating in. You can also discover new repositories, which are recommended based on users you're following and repositories you have starred. To only view activity for a specific organization, visit your organization's dashboard. For more information, see "About your personal dashboard" or "About your organization dashboard." default branch The base branch for new pull requests and code commits in a repository. Each repository has at least one branch, which Git creates when you initialize the repository. The first branch is usually called main, and is often the default branch. Dependents graph A repository graph that shows the packages, projects, and repositories that depend on a public repository. Dependencies graph A repository graph that shows the packages and projects that the repository depends on. deploy key A deploy key is an SSH key that is stored on your server and grants access to a single GitHub repository. This key is attached directly to the repository instead of to a personal user account. detached HEAD Git will warn you if you're working on a detached HEAD, which means that Git is not pointing to a branch and that any commits you make will not appear in commit history. For example, when you check out an arbitrary commit that is not the latest commit of any particular branch, you're working on a "detached HEAD." diagnostics An overview of a GitHub Enterprise instance's settings and environment. diff A diff is the difference in changes between two commits, or saved changes. The diff will visually describe what was added or removed from a file since its last commit. dirty A working tree is considered "dirty" if it contains modifications that have not been committed to the current branch. email notifications Notifications sent to a user's email address. Enterprise account Enterprise accounts allow you to centrally manage policy and billing for multiple GitHub.com organizations. Enterprise accounts are available with GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "About enterprise accounts." Explorer An instance of GraphiQL, which is a "graphical interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE." fast-forward A fast-forward is a special type of merge where you have a revision and you are "merging" another branch's changes that happen to be a descendant of what you have. In such a case, you do not make a new merge commit but instead just update to this revision. This will happen frequently on a remote-tracking branch of a remote repository. feature branch A branch used to experiment with a new feature or fix an issue that is not in production. Also called a topic branch. fenced code block An indented block of code you can create with GitHub Flavored Markdown using triple backticks ``` before and after the code block. See this example. fetch When you use git fetch, you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them. Unlike git pull, fetching allows you to review changes before committing them to your local branch. following (users) To get notifications about another user's contributions and activity. force push A Git push that overwrites the remote repository with local changes without regard for conflicts. fork A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository. You can also open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork synced with the latest changes since both repositories are still connected. Free plan A user account billing plan that is free. Users can collaborate on unlimited public repositories with unlimited collaborators. Gist A gist is a shareable file that you can edit, clone, and fork on GitHub. You can make a gist public or secret, although secret gists will be available to anyone with the URL.

You can view this file for your repository on the command line with git rev-parse --git-dir. that is the real repository. GraphQL A query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. HEAD A defined commit of a branch, usually the most recent commit at the tip of the branch. head branch The branch whose changes are combined into the base branch when you merge a pull request. Also known as the "compare branch." Hello, World A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to a user. Since this program is usually very simple, it is often used as an example of a programming language's basic syntax and serves as a common first exercise for learning a new programming language. high-availability A system or component that is continuously operational for a desirably long length of time. hook During the normal execution of several Git commands, call-outs are made to optional scripts that allow a developer to add functionality or checking. Typically, the hooks allow for a command to be pre-verified and potentially aborted, and allow for a post-notification after the operation is done. hostname Human-readable nicknames that correspond to the address of a device connected to a network. identicon An auto-generated image used as a default profile photo when users sign up for GitHub.

Management Console A section within the GitHub Enterprise interface that contains administrative features. Markdown Markdown is an incredibly simple semantic file format, not too dissimilar from .doc, .rtf and .txt. Markdown makes it easy for even those without a web-publishing background to write prose (including with links, lists, bullets, etc.) and have it displayed like a website. GitHub supports Markdown and uses a particular form of Markdown called GitHub Flavored Markdown. See GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec or Getting started with writing and formatting on GitHub. Markup A system for annotating and formatting a document. main The default development branch. Whenever you create a Git repository, a branch named main is created, and becomes the active branch. In most cases, this contains the local development, though that is purely by convention and is not required. master The default branch in many Git repositories. By default, when you create a new Git repository on the command line a branch called master is created. Many tools now use an alternative name for the default branch. For example, when you create a new repository on GitHub the default branch is called main. Members graph A repository graph that shows all the forks of a repository. mention A notification sent to a user by prefacing their username with the @ symbol. Users in an organization on GitHub can also be a part of a team that can be mentioned. merge Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A merge can be done through a pull request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line. merge conflict A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. The merge conflict must be resolved before you can merge the branches. milestone A way to track the progress on groups of issues or pull requests in a repository. mirror A new copy of a repository. nested team A child team of a parent team. You can have multiple children (or nested) teams. Network graph A repository graph that shows the branch history of the entire repository network, including branches of the root repository and branches of forks that contain commits unique to the network. News Feed An activity view of repositories or people you watch. An organization's News Feed shows activity on repositories owned by the organization. non-fast-forward When your local copy of a repository is out-of-sync with the upstream repository and you need to fetch the upstream changes before you push your local changes. notification Updates, delivered by either the web or email depending on your settings, that give you information about the activities you're interested in. OAuth App A third-party application that uses access tokens rather than passwords to access information for users. OAuth token The access token used in OAuth Apps to access information for users. outside collaborator A user who has been given access to one or more of an organization’s repositories, but has no other access to the organization and is not a member of the organization. open source Open source software is software that can be freely used, modified, and shared (in both modified and unmodified form) by anyone. Today the concept of "open source" is often extended beyond software, to represent a philosophy of collaboration in which working materials are made available online for anyone to fork, modify, discuss, and contribute to. organization Organizations are a group of two or more users that typically mirror real-world organizations. They are administered by users and can contain both repositories and teams. organization owner Users who have full administrative access to the organization they own. origin The default upstream repository. Most projects have at least one upstream project that they track. By default, origin is used for that purpose. owner Organization members that have complete administrative access to the organization. parent team Within nested teams, the main team from which child teams inherit access permissions and @mentions. participating notifications A notification about an update in a conversation in an issue or pull request where your username or team was mentioned or where you have previously replied in a comment. permalink A permanent static hyperlink to a particular web page. personal account A GitHub account that belongs to an individual user. primary email address The main email address where GitHub sends receipts, credit card or PayPal charges, and other billing-related communication. pinned repository A repository that a user has decided to display prominently on their profile. pre-receive hooks Scripts that run on the GitHub Enterprise server that you can use to implement quality checks. private contributions Contributions made to a private (vs. public) repository. private repository Private repositories are only visible to the repository owner and collaborators that the owner specified. production branch A branch with final changes that are ready to be used or deployed to an application or site. profile The page that shows information about a user's activity on GitHub. profile photo A custom image users upload to GitHub to identify their activity, usually along with their username. This is also referred to as an avatar. project board Boards within GitHub that are made up of issues, pull requests, and notes that are categorized as cards in columns. protected branch Protected branches block several features of Git on a branch that a repository administrator chooses to protect. They can't be force pushed, deleted, have changes merged without required checks passing or required reviews approved, or have files uploaded to it from the GitHub web interface. A protected branch is usually the default branch. public contributions Contributions made to a public (vs. private) repository. public repository A public repository can be viewed by anyone, including people who aren't GitHub users. pull Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date. See also fetch. pull access A synonym for read access. pull request Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum. pull request review Comments from collaborators on a pull request that approve the changes or request further changes before the pull request is merged. Pulse graph A repository graph that gives you an overview of a repository's activity. Punch graph A repository graph that shows the frequency of updates to a repository based on the day of week and time of day push To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them. push a branch When you successfully push a branch to a remote repository, you update the remote branch with changes from your local branch. When you "push a branch", Git will search for the branch's HEAD ref in the remote repository and verify that it is a direct ancestor to the branch's local HEAD ref. Once verified, Git pulls all objects (reachable from the local HEAD ref and missing from the remote repository) into the remote object database and then updates the remote HEAD ref. If the remote HEAD is not an ancestor to the local HEAD, the push fails. push access A synonym for write access. read access A permission level on a repository that allows the user to pull, or read, information from the repository. All public repositories give read access to all GitHub users. A synonym for pull access. README A text file containing information about the files in a repository that is typically the first file a visitor to your repository will see. A README file, along with a repository license, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, helps you share expectations and manage contributions to your project. rebase To reapply a series of changes from a branch to a different base, and reset the HEAD of that branch to the result. Recover Accounts Elsewhere Allows users to add an extra security factor to their GitHub account in case they lose access to their two-factor authentication method or recovery codes. Users can associate their GitHub account with their Facebook account by storing an authentication credential in the form of an account recovery token for their GitHub account with Facebook. recovery code A code that helps you regain access to your GitHub account. release GitHub's way of packaging and providing software to your users. remote This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. Remote versions can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced. remote repository A repository that is used to track the same project but resides somewhere else. remote URL The place where your code is stored: a repository on GitHub, another user's fork, or even a different server. replica A GitHub Enterprise instance that provides redundancy for the primary GitHub Enterprise instance. repository A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private. repository graph A visual representation of your repository's data. repository maintainer Someone who manages a repository. This person may help triage issues and use labels and other features to manage the work of the repository. This person may also be responsible for keeping the README and contributing files updated. required pull request review Required reviews ensure that pull requests have at least one approved review before collaborators can make changes to a protected branch. required status check Checks on pull requests that ensure all required CI tests are passing before collaborators can make changes to a protected branch. resolve The action of fixing up manually what a failed automatic merge left behind. revert When you revert a pull request on GitHub, a new pull request is automatically opened, which has one commit that reverts the merge commit from the original merged pull request. In Git, you can revert commits with git revert. review Reviews allow others with access to your repository to comment on the changes proposed in pull requests, approve the changes, or request further changes before the pull request is merged. root directory The first directory in a hierarchy. root filesystem The base operating system and the GitHub Enterprise application environment. saved reply A comment you can save and add to your GitHub user account so that you can use it across GitHub in issues and pull requests. scope Named groups of permissions that an OAuth App can request to access both public and non-public data. seat A user within a GitHub Enterprise organization. This may be referred to as "seat count." secret team A team that is only visible to the other people on the team and people with owner permissions. security log A log that lists the last 50 actions or those performed within the last 90 days. service hook Also called "webhook." Webhooks provide a way for notifications to be delivered to an external web server whenever certain actions occur on a repository or organization. single sign-on Also called SSO. Allows users to sign in to a single location - an identity provider (IdP) - that then gives the user access to other service providers. snapshot A checkpoint of a virtual machine at a point in time. squash To combine multiple commits into a single commit. Also a Git command. SSH key SSH keys are a way to identify yourself to an online server, using an encrypted message. It's as if your computer has its own unique password to another service. GitHub uses SSH keys to securely transfer information to your computer. staging instance A way to test modifications before they are applied to your actual GitHub Enterprise instance. status A visual representation within a pull request that your commits meet the conditions set for the repository you're contributing to. Status checks Status checks are external processes, such as continuous integration builds, which run for each commit you make in a repository. For more information, see "About status checks." star A bookmark or display of appreciation for a repository. Stars are a manual way to rank the popularity of projects. subscription A user or organization's GitHub plan. team A group of organization members that reflect your company or group's structure with cascading access permissions and mentions. team maintainer Organization members that have a subset of permissions available to organization owners to manage teams. Team plan An organization billing plan that gives you unlimited public and private repositories. timeline A series of events in a pull request or on a user profile. topic branch A regular Git branch that is used by a developer to identify a conceptual line of development. Since branches are very easy and inexpensive, it is often desirable to have several small branches that each contain very well defined concepts or small incremental yet related changes. Can also be called a feature branch. topics A way to explore repositories in a particular subject area, find projects to contribute to, and discover new solutions to a specific problem on GitHub. Traffic graph A repository graph that shows a repository's traffic, including full clones (not fetches), visitors from the past 14 days, referring sites, and popular content. transfer To transfer a repository means to change the owner of a repository. The new owner will be able to immediately administer the repository's contents, issues, pull requests, releases, and settings. upstream When talking about a branch or a fork, the primary branch on the original repository is often referred to as the "upstream", since that is the main place that other changes will come in from. The branch/fork you are working on is then called the "downstream". Also called origin. upstream branch The default branch that is merged into the branch in question (or the branch in question is rebased onto). It is configured via branch.<name>.remote and branch.<name>.merge. If the upstream branch of A is origin/B sometimes we say "A is tracking origin/B". user Users are people with personal GitHub accounts. Each user has a personal profile, and can own multiple repositories, public or private. They can create or be invited to join organizations or collaborate on another user's repository. username A user's handle on GitHub. visible team A team that can be viewed and @mentioned by every organization member. watch You can watch a repository or issue to receive notifications when updates are made to an issue or pull request. watching notifications A notification about activity in a repository a user has subscribed to. web notifications Notifications displayed in the web interface on GitHub: https://github.com/notifications webhooks Webhooks allow you to build or set up GitHub Apps which subscribe to certain events on GitHub.com.

In this article About stars Searching stars Sorting and filtering stars Browsing your friends' stars Further reading You can search, sort, and filter your starred repositories and topics on your stars page.' About stars Starring makes it easy to find a repository or topic again later. You can see all the repositories and topics you have starred by going to your stars page. You can star repositories and topics to discover similar projects on GitHub. When you star repositories or topics, GitHub may recommend related content in the discovery view of your news feed. For more information, see "Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub." Starring a repository also shows appreciation to the repository maintainer for their work. Many of GitHub's repository rankings depend on the number of stars a repository has. In addition, Explore shows popular repositories based on the number of stars they have. Searching stars You can use the search bar to quickly find repositories and topics you've starred. The search bar only searches based on the name of a repository or topic, and not on any other qualifiers (such as the size of the repository or when it was last updated). Sorting and filtering stars In the upper-right corner of your stars page, you can sort your starred repositories and topics by recently starred, recently active, and most stars. On the right side of the page, you can filter your list of starred repositories based on their language. Browsing your friends' stars In the lower-right corner of the page, you can also browse your friends' stars. You can use this to find new repositories and topics to star.

In this article Allowing GitHub's IP addresses Using a company or organization's network Troubleshooting the captcha Switching cloning methods Troubleshooting slow downloads and intermittent slow connections Troubleshooting with GitHub Debug Most often, connection problems occur because a firewall, proxy server, corporate network, or other network is configured in a way that blocks GitHub. Allowing GitHub's IP addresses Make sure your network is configured to allow GitHub's IP addresses. For more information, see "About GitHub's IP addresses." Using a company or organization's network If you're having connectivity problems on your company or organization's network, check with your network administrator to find out if the network has rules in place to block certain traffic. If there are rules in place, ask your network administrator to allow traffic to GitHub. Troubleshooting the captcha If you're unable to verify with the captcha: Ensure JavaScript is enabled on your browser. Ensure your browser is supported. If your browser isn't supported, upgrade your browser or install a supported browser. For a list of supported browsers, see "Supported browsers." Ensure your network configuration is not blocking https://octocaptcha.com/ or https://arkoselabs.com/. If you're behind a corporate firewall, contact your IT administrator to allow those domains. To verify access to these domains, visit https://octocaptcha.com/test and ensure the text "Connection successfully made!" is displayed, then visit https://client-demo.arkoselabs.com/github and ensure you are able to load the captcha. Ensure your browser does not have plug-ins or extensions that may be interfering with GitHub. If so, temporarily disable the plug-ins or extensions during captcha verification. Switching cloning methods Switching from cloning via SSH to cloning via HTTPS, or vice versa may improve connectivity. For more information, see "Cloning a repository from GitHub." If you're encountering timeouts with SSH, see "Error: Bad file number." Troubleshooting slow downloads and intermittent slow connections GitHub does not throttle bandwidth per user. If you're experiencing slow connections at certain times of day but not others, the slow speeds are most likely due to network congestion. Because GitHub cannot resolve network congestion, you should escalate the problem to your internet service provider. Troubleshooting with GitHub Debug If you've followed all of the troubleshooting suggestions above and are still having connection problems, you can follow the instructions on the GitHub Debug site to run tests and send a report to GitHub Support. For more information, see GitHub Debug. Did this doc help you? Privacy policy Want to learn about new docs features and updates? Sign up for updates! We're continually improving our docs.

In this article About username changes Repository references Links to your previous profile page Your Git commits Changing your username Further reading About username changes You can change your username to another username that is not currently in use. If the username you want is not available, you'll see information about whether you can request the username to be released when you type in the desired username. If the username is not eligible for release and you don't hold a trademark for the username, you can choose another username or keep your current username. GitHub Support cannot release the unavailable username for you. For more information, see "Changing your username." After changing your username, your old username becomes available for anyone else to claim. Most references to your repositories under the old username automatically change to the new username. However, some links to your profile won't automatically redirect. GitHub cannot set up redirects for: @mentions using your old username Links to gists that include your old username Repository references After you change your username, GitHub will automatically redirect references to your repositories. Web links to your existing repositories will continue to work. This can take a few minutes to complete after you make the change. Command line pushes from your local repository clones to the old remote tracking URLs will continue to work. If the new owner of your old username creates a repository with the same name as your repository, that will override the redirect entry and your redirect will stop working. Because of this possibility, we recommend you update all existing remote repository URLs after changing your username. For more information, see "Changing a remote's URL." Links to your previous profile page After changing your username, links to your previous profile page, such as https://github.com/previoususername, will return a 404 error. We recommend updating any links to your GitHub account from elsewhere, such as your LinkedIn or Twitter profile. Your Git commits Git commits that were associated with your GitHub-provided noreply email address won't be attributed to your new username and won't appear in your contributions graph. If your Git commits are associated with another email address you've added to your GitHub account, including the ID-based GitHub-provided noreply email address, they'll continue to be attributed to you and appear in your contributions graph after you've changed your username. For more information on setting your email address, see "Setting your commit email address." Changing your username In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings. In the left sidebar, click Account. In the "Change username" section, click Change username. Read the warnings about changing your username. If you still want to change your username, click I understand, let's change my username. Type a new username. If the username you've chosen is available, click Change my username. If the username you've chosen is unavailable, you can try a different username or one of the suggestions you see.

This allows more granular permissions for repositories that belong to the organization. In this article Keep your personal user account and create a new organization manually Convert your personal account into an organization automatically Further reading Warning: Before converting a user into an organization, keep these points in mind: You will no longer be able to sign into the converted user account. You will no longer be able to create or modify gists owned by the converted user account. An organization cannot be converted back to a user. The SSH keys, OAuth tokens, job profile, reactions, and associated user information, will not be transferred to the organization. This is only true for the user account that's being converted, not any of the user account's collaborators. Any commits made with the converted user account will no longer be linked to that account. The commits themselves will remain intact. Keep your personal user account and create a new organization manually If you want your organization to have the same name that you are currently using for your personal account, or if you want to keep your personal user account's information intact, then you must create a new organization and transfer your repositories to it instead of converting your user account into an organization. To retain your current user account name for your personal use, change the name of your personal user account to something new and wonderful. Create a new organization with the original name of your personal user account. Transfer your repositories to your new organization account. Convert your personal account into an organization automatically You can also convert your personal user account directly into an organization. Converting your account: Preserves the repositories as they are without the need to transfer them to another account manually Automatically invites collaborators to teams with permissions equivalent to what they had before For user accounts on GitHub Pro, automatically transitions billing to the paid GitHub Team without the need to re-enter payment information, adjust your billing cycle, or double pay at any time Create a new personal account, which you'll use to sign into GitHub and access the organization and your repositories after you convert. Leave any organizations the user account you're converting has joined. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings. In your user settings sidebar, click Organizations. Under "Transform account", click Turn into an organization. In the Account Transformation Warning dialog box, review and confirm the conversion. Note that the information in this box is the same as the warning at the top of this article. On the "Transform your user into an organization" page, under "Choose an organization owner", choose either the secondary personal account you created in the previous section or another user you trust to manage the organization. Choose your new organization's subscription and enter your billing information if prompted. Click Create Organization. Sign in to the new user account you created in step one, then use the context switcher to access your new organization. Tip: When you convert a user account into an organization, we'll add collaborators on repositories that belong to the account to the new organization as outside collaborators. You can then invite outside collaborators to become members of your new organization if you wish. For more information, see "Permission levels for an organization."

If you use your GitHub user account for both personal and work purposes, there are a few things to keep in mind when you leave your company or organization. In this article Leaving organizations Removing professional associations with personal repositories Before you leave your company, make sure you update the following information in your user account: Unverify your company email address by deleting it in your Email settings. You can then re-add it without verifying to keep any associated commits linked to your account. Change your primary email address from your company email to your personal email. Verify your new primary email address. Change your GitHub username to remove any references to your company or organization, if necessary. Leaving organizations If you've been working with repositories that belong to an organization, you'll want to remove yourself as a member of the organization. Note that if you are the organization owner, you should first transfer ownership of the organization to another person. Removing professional associations with personal repositories If you've been collaborating professionally with another person on repositories that belong to their personal user account, you'll want to remove yourself as a collaborator from those repositories. Stop watching repositories related to your work. You won't want those notifications anymore! Transfer repositories you own that others may need to continue working on after you leave. Delete forks that belong to you that are related to the work you were doing. Don't worry, deleting a fork doesn't delete the upstream repository. Delete local copies of your forks that may exist on your computer: $ rm -rf work_directory Did this doc help you? Privacy policy Want to learn about new docs features and updates?

In this article About commit email addresses Setting your commit email address on GitHub Setting your commit email address in Git About commit email addresses GitHub uses your commit email address to associate commits with your GitHub account. You can choose the email address that will be associated with the commits you push from the command line as well as web-based Git operations you make. For web-based Git operations, you can set your commit email address on GitHub. For commits you push from the command line, you can set your commit email address in Git. Any commits you made prior to changing your commit email address are still associated with your previous email address. Note: You cannot verify email addresses from disposable domains. If you'd like to keep your email address private, you can use a GitHub-provided noreply email address. For more information, see "Setting your commit email address on GitHub." If you'd like to keep your personal email address private, you can use a GitHub-provided no-reply email address as your commit email address. To use your noreply email address for commits you push from the command line, use that email address when you set your commit email address in Git. To use your noreply address for web-based Git operations, set your commit email address on GitHub and choose to Keep my email address private. You can also choose to block commits you push from the command line that expose your personal email address. For more information, see "Blocking command line pushes that expose your personal email." To ensure that commits are attributed to you and appear in your contributions graph, use an email address that is connected to your GitHub account, or the noreply email address provided to you in your email settings. For more information, see "Adding an email address to your GitHub account." Note: If you created your GitHub account after July 18, 2017, your GitHub-provided no-reply email address is a seven-digit ID number and your username in the form of ID+username@users.noreply.github.com. If you created your GitHub account prior to July 18, 2017, your GitHub-provided no-reply email address is your username in the form of username@users.noreply.github.com. You can get an ID-based GitHub-provided no-reply email address by selecting (or deselecting and reselecting) Keep my email address private in your email settings. If you use your GitHub-provided noreply email address to make commits and then change your username, those commits will not be associated with your GitHub account. This does not apply if you're using the ID-based GitHub-provided noreply address. For more information, see "Changing your GitHub username." Setting your commit email address on GitHub If you haven't enabled email address privacy, you can choose which verified email address to author changes with when you edit, delete, or create files or merge a pull request on GitHub. If you enabled email address privacy, then the commit author email address cannot be changed and is <username>@users.noreply.github.com by default. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings. In the left sidebar, click Emails. In "Add email address", type your email address and click Add. Verify your email address. In the "Primary email address" list, select the email address you'd like to associate with your web-based Git operations. To keep your email address private when performing web-based Git operations, click Keep my email address private. Setting your commit email address in Git You can use the git config command to change the email address you associate with your Git commits. The new email address you set will be visible in any future commits you push to GitHub from the command line. Any commits you made prior to changing your commit email address are still associated with your previous email address. Setting your email address for every repository on your computer Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash. Set an email address in Git. You can use your GitHub-provided no-reply email address or any email address. $ git config --global user.email "email@example.com" Confirm that you have set the email address correctly in Git: $ git config --global user.email
email@example.com Add the email address to your account on GitHub, so that your commits are attributed to you and appear in your contributions graph. For more information, see "Adding an email address to your GitHub account." Setting your email address for a single repository GitHub uses the email address set in your local Git configuration to associate commits pushed from the command line with your GitHub account. You can change the email address associated with commits you make in a single repository. This will override your global Git config settings in this one repository, but will not affect any other repositories. Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash. Change the current working directory to the local repository where you want to configure the email address that you associate with your Git commits. Set an email address in Git. You can use your GitHub-provided no-reply email address or any email address. $ git config user.email "email@example.com" Confirm that you have set the email address correctly in Git: $ git config user.email

Note: GitHub limits the number of people who can be invited to a repository within a 24-hour period. If you exceed this limit, either wait 24 hours or create an organization to collaborate with more people. Ask for the username of the person you're inviting as a collaborator. If they don't have a username yet, they can sign up for GitHub For more information, see "Signing up for a new GitHub account". On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. Under your repository name, click Settings. In the left sidebar, click Manage access. Click Invite a collaborator. In the search field, start typing the name of person you want to invite, then click a name in the list of matches. Click Add NAME to REPOSITORY.

Scheduled reminders for pull requests will send a message to you in Slack with open pull requests needing your review at a specified time. For example, you can setup scheduled reminders to send you a message in Slack every morning at 10 AM with pull requests needing to be reviewed by you or one of your teams.

You can set scheduled reminders for personal or team-level review requests for pull requests in organizations you are a member of. Before you can create a scheduled reminder for yourself, an organization owner must authorize your Slack workspace. For more information, see "Managing scheduled reminders for your organization."

You can replace your identicon with an image that represents you. Tip: Your profile picture should be a PNG, JPG, or GIF file under 1 MB in size. For the best quality rendering, we recommend keeping the image at about 500 by 500 pixels.

In this article What counts as a contribution Popular repositories Pinned repositories Contributions calendar Activity overview Contribution activity Viewing contributions from your GitHub Enterprise Server instance on GitHub.com Further reading Your contribution graph shows activity from public repositories. You can choose to show activity from both public and private repositories, with specific details of your activity in private repositories anonymized. For more information, see "Publicizing or hiding your private contributions on your profile." Note: Commits will only appear on your contributions graph if the email address you used to author the commits is connected to your account on GitHub. For more information, see "Why are my contributions not showing up on my profile?" What counts as a contribution On your profile page, certain actions count as contributions: Committing to a repository's default branch or gh-pages branch Opening an issue Proposing a pull request Submitting a pull request review Notes: When rebasing commits, the original authors of the commit and the person who rebased the commits, whether on the command line or on GitHub, receive contribution credit. Popular repositories This section displays your repositories with the most watchers. Once you pin repositories to your profile, this section will change to "Pinned repositories." Pinned repositories This section displays up to six public repositories and can include your repositories as well as repositories you've contributed to. To easily see important details about the repositories you've chosen to feature, each repository in this section includes a summary of the work being done, the number of stars the repository has received, and the main programming language used in the repository. For more information, see "Pinning repositories to your profile." Contributions calendar Your contributions calendar shows your contribution activity. Viewing contributions from specific times Click on a day's square to show the contributions made during that 24-hour period. Press Shift and click on another day's square to show contributions made during that time span. Note: You can select up to a one-month range on your contributions calendar. If you select a larger time span, we will only display one month of contributions. How contribution event times are calculated Timestamps are calculated differently for commits and pull requests: Commits use the time zone information in the commit timestamp. For more information, see "Troubleshooting commits on your timeline." Pull requests and issues opened on GitHub use your browser's time zone. Those opened via the API use the timestamp or time zone specified in the API call. Activity overview When you enable the activity overview section on your profile, viewers can see more information about the types of contributions you make and repositories you're most active in. A viewer can only see information in the activity overview about repositories they have read access to. Once enabled, a viewer can also filter your contribution graph and activity timeline for a specific organization. For more information, see "Showing an overview of your activity on your profile." The organizations featured in the activity overview are prioritized according to how active you are in the organization. If you @mention an organization in your profile bio, and you’re an organization member, then that organization is prioritized first in the activity overview. For more information, see “Mentioning people and teams” or "Adding a bio to your profile." Contribution activity The contribution activity section includes a detailed timeline of your work, including commits you've made or co-authored, pull requests you've proposed, and issues you've opened. You can see your contributions over time by either clicking Show more activity at the bottom of your contribution activity or by clicking the year you're interested in viewing on the right side of the page. Important moments, like the date you joined an organization, proposed your first pull request, or opened a high-profile issue, are highlighted in your contribution activity. If you can't see certain events in your timeline, check to make sure you still have access to the organization or repository where the event happened. Viewing contributions from your GitHub Enterprise Server instance on GitHub.com If your site administrator has enabled unified contributions, you can send GitHub Enterprise contribution counts to your GitHub.com profile.

Your profile contributions graph is a record of contributions you've made to GitHub repositories. Contributions are timestamped according to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than your local time zone. Contributions are only counted if they meet certain criteria. In some cases, we may need to rebuild your graph in order for contributions to appear. In this article Contributions that are counted Common reasons that contributions are not counted Further reading Contributions that are counted Issues, pull requests and discussions Issues, pull requests and discussions will appear on your contribution graph if they were opened in a standalone repository, not a fork. Commits Commits will appear on your contributions graph if they meet all of the following conditions: The email address used for the commits is associated with your GitHub account. The commits were made in a standalone repository, not a fork. The commits were made: In the repository's default branch In the gh-pages branch (for repositories with project sites) For more information on project sites, see "About GitHub Pages." In addition, at least one of the following must be true: You are a collaborator on the repository or are a member of the organization that owns the repository. You have forked the repository. You have opened a pull request or issue in the repository. You have starred the repository. Common reasons that contributions are not counted Notes: When rebasing commits, the original authors of the commit and the person who rebased the commits, whether on the command line or on GitHub, receive contribution credit. Commit was made less than 24 hours ago After making a commit that meets the requirements to count as a contribution, you may need to wait for up to 24 hours to see the contribution appear on your contributions graph. Your local Git commit email isn't connected to your account Commits must be made with an email address that is connected to your account on GitHub, or the GitHub-provided noreply email address provided to you in your email settings, in order to appear on your contributions graph. For more information about noreply email addresses, see "Setting your commit email address." You can check the email address used for a commit by adding .patch to the end of a commit URL, e.g. https://github.com/octocat/octocat.github.io/commit/67c0afc1da354d8571f51b6f0af8f2794117fd10.patch: From 67c0afc1da354d8571f51b6f0af8f2794117fd10 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: The Octocat <octocat@nowhere.com>
Date: Sun, 27 Apr 2014 15:36:39 +0530
Subject: [PATCH] updated index for better welcome message
 The email address in the From: field is the address that was set in the local git config settings. In this example, the email address used for the commit is octocat@nowhere.com. If the email address used for the commit is not connected to your account on GitHub, you must add the email address to your GitHub account. Your contributions graph will be rebuilt automatically when you add the new address. Generic email addresses--such as jane@computer.local--cannot be added to GitHub accounts. If you use such an email for your commits, the commits will not be linked to your GitHub profile and will not show up in your contributions graph. Commit was not made in the default or gh-pages branch Commits are only counted if they are made in the default branch or the gh-pages branch (for repositories with project sites). For more information, see "About GitHub Pages." If your commits are in a non-default or non-gh-pages branch and you'd like them to count toward your contributions, you will need to do one of the following: Open a pull request to have your changes merged into the default branch or the gh-pages branch. Change the default branch of the repository. Changing the default branch of the repository will change it for all repository collaborators. Only do this if you want the new branch to become the base against which all future pull requests and commits will be made. Commit was made in a fork Commits made in a fork will not count toward your contributions. To make them count, you must do one of the following: Open a pull request to have your changes merged into the parent repository. To detach the fork and turn it into a standalone repository on GitHub, contact GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support. If the fork has forks of its own, let GitHub Support know if the forks should move with your repository into a new network or remain in the current network. For more information, see "About forks."

If you don't see commits you expect on your profile or can't find commit details from your profile page, the commit date and the commit author date may be different. In this article Expected behavior to view commit details Missing commit details from commits in your timeline How GitHub uses the Git author date and commit date Viewing missing commit details from commits in your timeline Expected commits missing in your timeline Expected behavior to view commit details On your profile page's timeline, you can click the number of commits next to a specific repository to see more details about your commits from that time period, including a diff of specific changes made in a repository. Missing commit details from commits in your timeline If you click a commit link from your profile page and don't see all of the expected commits on the repository's commits page, then it's possible the commit history in Git was rewritten and the commit author date and the commit date are different. How GitHub uses the Git author date and commit date In Git, the author date is when someone first creates a commit with git commit. The commit date is identical to the author date unless someone changes the commit date by using git commit --amend, a force push, a rebase, or other Git commands. On your profile page, the author date is used to calculate when a commit was made. Whereas, in a repository, the commit date is used to calculate when a commit was made in the repository. Most often, the author date and commit date are the same but you may notice that your commit sequence is out of order if the commit history is changed. For more information, see "Why are my contributions not showing up on my profile?" Viewing missing commit details from commits in your timeline You can use the git show command with the --pretty=fuller flag to check if the commit author date and commit date are different. $ git show Your commit SHA number --pretty=fuller
commit Your commit SHA number
Author:     octocat user email

Commit:     Sally Johnson user email
CommitDate: Tue Apr 10 06:25:08 2018 +0900 If the author and commit date are different, you can manually change the commit date in the URL to see the commit details. For example: This URL uses the author date of 2018-04-03: https://github.com/your-organization-or-personal-account/your-repository/commits?author=octocat&since=2018-04-03T00:00:00Z&until=2018-04-03T23:59:59Z This URL uses the commit date of 2018-04-10: https://github.com/your-organization-or-personal-account/your-repository/commits?author=octocat&since=2018-04-10T00:00:00Z&until=2018-04-10T23:59:59Z When you open the URL with the modified commit date, you can see the commit details. Expected commits missing in your timeline If you're not seeing expected commits on your timeline, it's possible the commit history in Git was rewritten and the commit author date and the commit date are different.

About authentication to GitHub→ You can securely access your account's resources by authenticating to GitHub, using different credentials depending on where you authenticate. Creating a strong password→ Secure your GitHub account with a strong and unique password using a password manager. Updating your GitHub access credentials→ GitHub credentials include not only your password, but also the access tokens, SSH keys, and application API tokens you use to communicate with GitHub. Should you have the need, you can reset all of these access credentials yourself. Creating a personal access token→ You should create a personal access token to use in place of a password with the command line or with the API. Reviewing your SSH keys→ To keep your credentials secure, you should regularly audit your SSH keys, deploy keys, and review authorized applications that access your GitHub account. Reviewing your deploy keys→ You should review deploy keys to ensure that there aren't any unauthorized (or possibly compromised) keys. You can also approve existing deploy keys that are valid. Authorizing OAuth Apps→ You can connect your GitHub identity to third-party applications using OAuth. When authorizing an OAuth App, you should ensure you trust the application, review who it's developed by, and review the kinds of information the application wants to access. Reviewing your authorized integrations→ You can review your authorized integrations to audit the access that each integration has to your account and data. Connecting with third-party applications→ You can connect your GitHub identity to third-party applications using OAuth. When authorizing one of these applications, you should ensure you trust the application, review who it's developed by, and review the kinds of information the application wants to access. Reviewing your authorized applications (OAuth)→ You should review your authorized applications to verify that no new applications with expansive permissions are authorized, such as those that have access to your private repositories. Reviewing your security log→ You can review the security log for your user account to better understand actions you've performed and actions others have performed that involve you. Removing sensitive data from a repository→ If you commit sensitive data, such as a password or SSH key into a Git repository, you can remove it from the history. To entirely remove unwanted files from a repository's history you can use either the git filter-branch command or the BFG Repo-Cleaner open source tool. About anonymized image URLs→ If you upload an image to GitHub, the URL of the image will be modified so your information is not trackable. About GitHub's IP addresses→ GitHub serves applications from multiple IP address ranges, which are available using the API. GitHub's SSH key fingerprints→ Public key fingerprints can be used to validate a connection to a remote server. Sudo mode→ GitHub asks you for your password before you can modify your email address, authorize third-party applications, or add new public keys, or initiate other sudo-protected actions. Preventing unauthorized access→ You may be alerted to a security incident in the media, such as the discovery of the Heartbleed bug, or your computer could be stolen while you're signed in to GitHub. In such cases, changing your password prevents any unintended future access to your account and projects. Did this doc help you? Privacy policy Want to learn about new docs features and updates?

In this article About authentication to GitHub Authenticating in your browser Authenticating with GitHub Desktop Authenticating with the API Authenticating with the command line About authentication to GitHub To keep your account secure, you must authenticate before you can access certain resources on GitHub. When you authenticate to GitHub, you supply or confirm credentials that are unique to you to prove that you are exactly who you declare to be. You can access your resources in GitHub in a variety of ways: in the browser, via GitHub Desktop or another desktop application, with the API, or via the command line. Each way of accessing GitHub supports different modes of authentication. Username and password with two-factor authentication Personal access token SSH key Authenticating in your browser You can authenticate to GitHub in your browser in different ways. Username and password only You'll create a password when you create your user account on GitHub. We recommend that you use a password manager to generate a random and unique password. For more information, see "Creating a strong password." Two-factor authentication (2FA) (recommended) If you enable 2FA, we'll also prompt you to provide a code that's generated by an application on your mobile device or sent as a text message (SMS) after you successfully enter your username and password. For more information, see "Accessing GitHub using two-factor authentication." In addition to authentication with a mobile application or a text message, you can optionally add a secondary method of authentication with a security key using WebAuthn. For more information, see "Configuring two-factor authentication using a security key." Authenticating with GitHub Desktop You can authenticate with GitHub Desktop using your browser. For more information, see "Authenticating to GitHub." Authenticating with the API You can authenticate with the API in different ways. Personal access tokens In limited situations, such as testing, you can use a personal access token to access the API. Using a personal access token enables you to revoke access at any time. For more information, see "Creating a personal access token." Web application flow For OAuth Apps in production, you should authenticate using the web application flow. For more information, see "Authorizing OAuth Apps." GitHub Apps For GitHub Apps in production, you should authenticate on behalf of the app installation. For more information, see "Authenticating with GitHub Apps." Authenticating with the command line You can access repositories on GitHub from the command line in two ways, HTTPS and SSH, and both have a different way of authenticating. The method of authenticating is determined based on whether you choose an HTTPS or SSH remote URL when you clone the repository. For more information about which way to access, see "Which remote URL should I use?" You can work with all repositories on GitHub over HTTPS, even if you are behind a firewall or proxy. Every time you use Git to authenticate with GitHub, you'll be prompted to enter your credentials to authenticate with GitHub, unless you cache them with a credential helper. When Git prompts you for your password, enter your personal access token (PAT) instead. Password-based authentication for Git is deprecated, and using a PAT is more secure. For more information, see "Creating a personal access token." You can work with all repositories on GitHub over SSH, although firewalls and proxys might refuse to allow SSH connections. Using SSH requires you to generate an SSH public/private keypair on your local machine and add the public key to your GitHub account. Every time you use Git to authenticate with GitHub, you'll be prompted to enter your SSH key passphrase, unless you've stored the key. For more information, see "Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent." To use a personal access token or SSH key to access resources owned by an organization that uses SAML single sign-on, you must also authorize the personal token or SSH key. For more information, see "Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on" or "Authorizing an SSH key for use with SAML single sign-on." Did this doc help you?

You must choose or generate a password for your GitHub account that is at least: Eight characters long, if it includes a number and a lowercase letter, or 16 characters long with any combination of characters To keep your account secure, we recommend you follow these best practices: Use a password manager, such as LastPass or 1Password, to generate a password more than 16 characters. Generate a unique password for GitHub. If you use your GitHub password elsewhere and that service is compromised, then attackers or other malicious actors could use that information to access your GitHub account. Configure two-factor authentication for your personal account. For more information, see "About two-factor authentication." Never share your password, even with a potential collaborator. Each person should use their own personal account on GitHub. For more information on ways to collaborate, see: "Inviting collaborators to a personal repository," "About collaborative development models," or "Collaborating with groups in organizations." When you type a password to sign in, create an account, or change your password, GitHub will check if the password you entered is considered weak according to datasets like HaveIBeenPwned. The password may be identified as weak even if you have never used that password before. GitHub only inspects the password at the time you type it, and never stores the password you entered in plaintext. For more information, see HaveIBeenPwned. You can only use your password to log on to GitHub using your browser. When you authenticate to GitHub with other means, such as the command line or API, you should use other credentials. For more information, see "About authentication to GitHub." When Git prompts you for your password, enter your personal access token (PAT) instead. Password-based authentication for Git is deprecated, and using a PAT is more secure. For more information, see "Creating a personal access token."

In this article Creating a token Using a token on the command line Further reading Personal access tokens (PATs) are an alternative to using passwords for authentication to GitHub when using the GitHub API or the command line. If you want to use a PAT to access resources owned by an organization that uses SAML SSO, you must authorize the PAT. For more information, see "About authentication with SAML single sign-on" and "Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on." As a security precaution, GitHub automatically removes personal access tokens that haven't been used in a year. Creating a token Verify your email address, if it hasn't been verified yet. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings. In the left sidebar, click Developer settings. In the left sidebar, click Personal access tokens. Click Generate new token. Give your token a descriptive name. Select the scopes, or permissions, you'd like to grant this token. To use your token to access repositories from the command line, select repo. Click Generate token. Click to copy the token to your clipboard. For security reasons, after you navigate off the page, you will not be able to see the token again. Warning: Treat your tokens like passwords and keep them secret. When working with the API, use tokens as environment variables instead of hardcoding them into your programs. To use your token to authenticate to an organization that uses SAML SSO, authorize the token for use with a SAML single-sign-on organization. Using a token on the command line Once you have a token, you can enter it instead of your password when performing Git operations over HTTPS. For example, on the command line you would enter the following: $ git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
Username: your_username
Password: your_token Personal access tokens can only be used for HTTPS Git operations. If your repository uses an SSH remote URL, you will need to switch the remote from SSH to HTTPS. If you are not prompted for your username and password, your credentials may be cached on your computer. You can update your credentials in the Keychain to replace your old password with the token.

You can also approve existing deploy keys that are valid. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. Under your repository name, click Settings. In the left sidebar, click Deploy keys. On the Deploy keys page, take note of the deploy keys associated with your account. For those that you don't recognize, or that are out-of-date, click Delete. If there are valid deploy keys you'd like to keep, click Approve. For more information, see "Managing deploy keys." Did this doc help you?
